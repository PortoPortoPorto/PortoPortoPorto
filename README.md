- 👋 Hi, I’m @PortoPortoPorto
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, (RPGs, Horror, Strategy, Fighting etc) literature, music, film, philosophy, Scottish football and currently, learning to CODE!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vanilla JS. (diving into APIs, which feels like a step) My skillset is currently limited, yet I'm putting in the hours and working on gradually growing and expanding the repertoire. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to connect with people at a similar, or slightly higher level of experience than myself, in order to share ideas and provide feedback on mini-projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me on Discord (MyNameIsPorto ID: 711403973755535422)
